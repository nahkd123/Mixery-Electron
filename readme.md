# Mixery Electron
Hello. This is the Election version of Mixery. Instead of hosting files online, you can now use Mixery as an Electron application!

## Build
Build Mixery Electron is simple. But you need ``node``, ``npm`` and ``typescript`` npm module (yes install it globally) to build.

Simply run ``npm run build``, then grab the latest package inside ``packages`` directory.
